âœ… **Tips for making it visually nicer on GitHub:**
1. Use **badges** for license, build, or version.
2. Add **screenshots** or GIFs for usage.
3. Use **horizontal rules (`---`)** to separate sections.
4. Use **emojis** (âœ…, âš¡, ðŸ› ) for visual appeal.

If you want, I can **rewrite your README.md so it looks exactly like a professional template with badges, screenshots placeholders, emojis, and nice section dividers**, ready to just copy-paste.  

Do you want me to do that?
